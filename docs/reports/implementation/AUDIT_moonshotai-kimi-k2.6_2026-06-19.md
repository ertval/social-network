## Executive Summary

| Metric | Plan | Actual | Status |
|--------|------|--------|--------|
| Agents | 9 named + flowmaster | 10 files (9 named + 1 extra) | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Gate scripts | 11 (10 + run-all) | 11 present | ✅ PASS |
| lefthook.yml | Required | ✅ Present | ✅ PASS |
| go-arch-lint.yml | Required | ✅ Present | ✅ PASS |
| Makefile targets | 4 new | 4 added | ✅ PASS |
| golangci.yml D5 rules | Required | ✅ Present | ✅ PASS |
| Section tags in conventions.md | Required | ✅ Present | ✅ PASS |
| opencode.json registration | Required | ❌ NOT DONE | 🔴 CRITICAL |

**Overall verdict**: ~85% correctly implemented. Infrastructure is solid, but critical registration step is missing.

## Part 1: Context Restructuring — Findings

### 1.1 Section Tags in conventions.md ✅

| Section | Status | Lines |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `rules-core` (D1-D6, TDD, security) | ✅ Present | L11-76 |
| `rules-fe` (Frontend) | ✅ Present | L78-90 |
| `rules-ci` (CI gates) | ✅ Present | L92-111 |
| `rules-git` (Branch naming, PRs) | ✅ Present | L113-129 |
| `rules-dod` (Definition of Done) | ✅ Present | L131-145 |

**Verdict**: CORRECT. All 5 section tags match plan exactly.

### 1.2 Dropped Files from Agent Context ❌

Plan §70-75 requires dropping these from agent context:
- `general-instructions.md`
- `target-architecture-with-phases.md`

**Actual**: `conventions.md` line 9 STILL references `general-instructions.md`:
```
Refer to [general-instructions.md](../../docs/sprints/general-instructions.md) for detailed workflows.
```

**Verdict**: PARTIAL. The files are no longer in agent context (agents reference only `conventions.md` sections), but `conventions.md` itself still references the dropped file, creating a dead link for agents.

**Severity**: MEDIUM — Agents may try to follow this reference.

## Part 2: QRSPI Agent Architecture — Findings

### 2.1 Agent File Inventory

| Agent | Required | Found | Status |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| `flowmaster` | ✅ | ✅ flowmaster.md | ✅ PASS |
| `scout` | ✅ | ✅ scout.md | ✅ PASS |
| `architect` | ✅ | ✅ architect.md | ✅ PASS |
| `forge` | ✅ | ✅ forge.md | ✅ PASS |
| `review-gates` | ✅ | ✅ review-gates.md | ✅ PASS |
| `review-conventions` | ✅ | ✅ review-conventions.md | ✅ PASS |
| `review-analysis` | ✅ | ✅ review-analysis.md | ✅ PASS |
| `remedy` | ✅ | ✅ remedy.md | ✅ PASS |
| `publish` | ✅ | ✅ publish.md | ✅ PASS |
| `audit` | ❌ NOT IN PLAN | ❌ audit.md | ⚠️ EXTRA |

**Note**: Plan §727-740 says "10 agents" but only lists 9 in the table. The mermaid diagram at §106-127 shows 8 subagents + flowmaster. There is confusion in the plan itself.

**Finding**: `audit.md` is present but NOT in the plan. Plan replaces the old `pr-review` with 3 review agents (review-gates, review-conventions, review-analysis). The old `audit` agent should not exist.

**Severity**: LOW — Extra file is harmless but not in plan.

### 2.2 Agent Context Lists — Section Tag References

| Agent | Plan says | Actually references | Status |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| `scout` | `rules-core` | `rules-core` ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| `architect` | `rules-core` + `rules-ci` | `rules-core` + `rules-ci` ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| `forge` | `rules-core` + `rules-ci` | `rules-core` + `rules-ci` ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| `review-analysis` | `rules-core` | `rules-core` ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| `publish` | `rules-git` + `rules-dod` | Not specified in agent file | ⚠️ MISSING |
| `review-conventions` | ALL sections | `ALL sections` ✅ | ✅ PASS |

**Finding**: `publish.md` does NOT specify its context sections. It reads `RESEARCH.md` and `PLAN.md` but doesn't state which sections of `conventions.md` it needs. Plan says `rules-git` + `rules-dod`.

**Severity**: LOW — The agent still functions but context is not optimized.

### 2.3 Agent Permissions — Task Denial

Plan §129: "All subagents have `task: {"*": deny}`. Only `flowmaster` has `task: {"*": allow}`."

| Agent | task permission | Plan says | Status |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| `scout` | `"*": deny` | deny | ✅ PASS |
| `architect` | `"*": deny` | deny | ✅ PASS |
| `forge` | `"*": deny` | deny | ✅ PASS |
| `review-gates` | `"*": deny` | deny | ✅ PASS |
| `review-conventions` | `"*": deny` | deny | ✅ PASS |
| `review-analysis` | `"*": deny` | deny | ✅ PASS |
| `remedy` | `"*`: deny` | deny | ✅ PASS |
| `publish` | `"*`: deny` | deny | ✅ PASS |
| `flowmaster` | `"*": allow` | allow | ✅ PASS |

**Verdict**: CORRECT. All agents have correct task permissions.

---

## Part 3: Deterministic Gates + Local Hooks — Findings

### 3.1 Lefthook (L0)

| Requirement | Status | Note |
|-------------|--------|------|
| `lefthook.yml` present | ✅ | Yes |
| `pre-commit` with `go-format` + `go-vet` | ✅ | Yes, parallel |
| `pre-push` with `go-test`, `go-build`, `arch-lint` | ✅ | Yes, parallel |
| `gofumpt` + `goimports` | ✅ | Yes |
| `-local social-network` in goimports | ✅ | Yes |

**Verdict**: CORRECT.

### 3.2 Gate Scripts (L1)

Plan §461 lists 10 gates + `run-all.sh` = 11 scripts:
1. `run-all.sh` — ✅ Present
2. `check-stack.sh` — ✅ Present
3. `check-d1-layout.sh` — ✅ Present
4. `check-d5-boundaries.sh` — ✅ Present
5. `check-d6-dag.sh` — ✅ Present
6. `check-tdd.sh` — ✅ Present
7. `check-migrations.sh` — ✅ Present
8. `check-security.sh` — ✅ Present
9. `check-branch.sh` — ✅ Present
10. `check-scope-drift.sh` — ✅ Present
11. `check-coverage-delta.sh` — ✅ Present

**Finding**: 11 scripts present, 11 expected. ✅ PASS

#### 3.2.1 Script Quality Issues

**`check-coverage-delta.sh`** — CRITICAL BUG
```bash
MAIN_COV=$(git stash -q 2>/dev/null; git checkout main -q 2>/dev/null && \
  go test -coverprofile=/tmp/main.cov ./... 2>/dev/null && \
  go tool cover -func=/tmp/main.cov | tail -1 | awk '{print $3}' | tr -d '%'; \
  git checkout - -q 2>/dev/null; git stash pop -q 2>/dev/null)
```

Problems:
1. `git stash` can fail if nothing to stash (but `-q` suppresses error, `set -e` ignores it since it's in a subshell... actually `set -e` doesn't apply to command substitution failures)
2. `git checkout main` then `git checkout -` is destructive — if the script is interrupted between these, the working tree is left on main
3. `git stash pop` can fail if stash was never created, leaving working tree clean
4. No trap to restore state on failure
5. If working tree has uncommitted changes, they get stashed and popped, but merge conflicts from `git stash pop` are not handled

**Severity**: HIGH — This script modifies git state and doesn't safely restore it.

**`check-d6-dag.sh`** — MEDIUM BUG

The script skips `domain`, `infra`, and `app` dirs but the plan says it should only skip `core`, `platform`, `pkg`, `config`, `bootstrap`. The extra skips are:
- `domain` (line 11)
- `infra` (line 11)
- `app` (line 11)

These are from the old codebase structure, not the new D1 vertical slice structure. The script still works but checks fewer directories than the plan intended.

**Severity**: LOW — Doesn't break anything, just skips checks.

### 3.3 go-arch-lint (L2)

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| `.go-arch-lint.yml` present | ✅ Yes |
| Feature slices defined (9) | ✅ Yes |
| Cross-cutting components | ✅ Yes |
| D6 dependency DAG rules | ✅ Yes |
| `bootstrap: anyVendorDeps` | ✅ Yes |

**Verdict**: CORRECT.

### 3.4 golangci.yml D5 depguard rules

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| `d5_commands_queries` rule | ✅ Present (lines 92-100) |
| `d5_transport` rule | ✅ Present (lines 101-106) |
| `d5_store` rule | ✅ Present (lines 107-116) |

**Verdict**: CORRECT.

### 3.5 Makefile Targets

| Target | Plan | Present | Status |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| `check-arch` | ✅ | ✅ line 284 | ✅ PASS |
| `review-gates` | ✅ | ✅ line 273 | ✅ PASS |
| `setup-hooks` | ✅ | ✅ line 288 | ✅ PASS |
| `setup-arch-lint` | ✅ | ✅ line 293 | ✅ PASS |

**Verdict**: CORRECT. Plan's 4 targets all present.

---

## Part 4: opencode.json Registration — CRITICAL

**Plan**: Agents should be registered in opencode configuration.

**Actual** (`.opencode/opencode.json`):
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json"
}
```

**Finding**: opencode.json is EMPTY. No agent definitions. No model assignments. No references to any agent files.

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL — Without opencode.json registration, the agents are NOT discoverable or usable by the opencode system. They are orphaned markdown files.

---

## Summary of All Findings

### 🔴 CRITICAL (2)
1. **opencode.json is empty** — Agents are not registered, making them undiscoverable
2. **check-coverage-delta.sh modifies git state unsafely** — Can leave working tree on main or lose uncommitted changes

### 🟡 HIGH (2)
3. **conventions.md still references dropped file** — Line 9 references `general-instructions.md` which plan says to drop
4. **Plan-actual mismatch in agent count** — Plan says 10 agents but lists 9; we have 10 files (9 named + 1 extra `audit.md`)

### 🟢 LOW (3)
5. **Extra agent `audit.md`** — Not in plan, harmless
6. **publish.md doesn't specify context sections** — Missing `rules-git` + `rules-dod` guidance
7. **check-d6-dag.sh skips extra directories** — Skips `domain`, `infra`, `app` not in plan

---

## Recommendations

1. **Fix opencode.json** — Register all 9 agents with their paths, models, and permissions
2. **Fix check-coverage-delta.sh** — Use `git worktree` or at minimum add trap for safe cleanup
3. **Remove or clarify audit.md** — Either delete it or add to plan
4. **Fix conventions.md line 9** — Remove reference to `general-instructions.md` or add context explaining it's for manual QA only
5. **Add context sections to publish.md** — Specify `rules-git` + `rules-dod` focus
