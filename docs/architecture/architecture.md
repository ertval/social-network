# High-Level Architecture & Code Organization

> **Target architecture.** The current codebase uses a layered structure under `internal/domain/`, `internal/app/`, `internal/infra/`. This document describes the vertical-slice target state after all refactoring phases. See [target-architecture-with-phases.md](target-architecture-with-phases.md) for the migration plan.

This document provides a concise, high-level overview of the architectural patterns, code organization, and structural boundaries governing the Social Network application.

## 1. Guiding Principles

1. **One Pattern, Everywhere**: Maintain strict consistency across features. If multiple approaches exist, we select one standard pattern and enforce it uniformly.
2. **Feature-Based Vertical Slices with CQRS**: Features are modular, self-contained packages. Each use case (one business operation) lives in its own file inside `commands/` (writes) or `queries/` (reads) subfolders. Store and transport remain shared per-feature.
3. **Decoupled Infrastructure**: External services (database, event bus, cache) are behind abstract interfaces in `internal/platform/`. Changing the concrete implementation (e.g., SQLite to PostgreSQL, or memory channel to RabbitMQ) requires zero modification to feature slices.

## 2. Directory Structure & Code Organization

The project is structured around self-contained vertical slices inside `internal/` and decoupled cross-cutting layers:

```

## 3. Vertical Slice Layout

Each feature slice within `internal/<feature>/` adheres to a strict internal structure. Each **use case** is its own file inside `commands/` or `queries/`:

```
internal/<feature>/
  ├── <feature>.go           # Domain entity structs, Repository interface, domain errors
  ├── commands/
  │     ├── <use_case>.go    # One file per write operation (validation + logic + event publishing)
  │     └── ...              # Additional command use cases
  ├── queries/
  │     ├── <use_case>.go    # One file per read operation (access checks + data projection)
  │     └── ...              # Additional query use cases
  ├── transport/
  │     ├── http.go          # REST HTTP handlers — delegates to commands/queries
  │     └── ws.go            # WebSocket handlers (chat & group chat only)
  └── store/
        └── sqlite.go        # Concrete SQLite repository implementation (all SQL in one file)
```

**Why this layout:**
- The **commands/ and queries/** layer is where complexity lives (privacy checks, event publishing, MIME validation). Splitting it per use case isolates each operation.
- The **store** layer is thin SQL (5–15 lines per method). One file per feature keeps all queries reviewable in one place.
- The **transport** layer is a thin HTTP adapter. One file per feature avoids handler fragmentation.

### Boundary & Dependency Rules

To keep vertical slices clean and decouple business logic from infrastructure details, we enforce strict boundary checks:

1. **No Outward Store/Transport Imports**: The feature root (`<feature>.go`) and `commands/`/`queries/` files **must not** import their own `transport/` or `store/` packages, nor may they import another feature's `transport/` or `store/` packages.
2. **Platform Interfaces Only**: Feature logic interacts with storage only through its own `Repository` interface and with database connections via the `platform/database.DB` interface.
3. **No Direct Feature-to-Feature Cross-Imports**: Slices communicate with each other through **narrow consumer-defined interfaces** (defined locally in the command/query file) or asynchronously via the **Event Bus**.
4. **Store Isolation**: `store/sqlite.go` must not import `commands/`, `queries/`, or `transport/`.

---

## 4. Cross-Slice Communication

To prevent circular dependencies and tight coupling, features interact via three defined patterns:

| Integration Type | Strategy | Implementation Example |
|------------------|----------|------------------------|
| **Data References** | ID-only mapping | A `Comment` struct contains an `AuthorID string` rather than embedding a `User` struct. |
| **Synchronous Queries** | Consumer-defined interfaces | `internal/chat/commands/send_private_msg.go` defines a narrow local `FollowChecker` interface, which is satisfied by `internal/follow` during bootstrapping. |
| **Asynchronous Effects** | Event Bus pub/sub | `internal/follow/commands/follow_user.go` publishes a `follow.requested` event. `internal/notification/commands/consume_events.go` subscribes to it to dispatch alerts. |

---

## 5. Dependency Graph

Features import only what they need, keeping the graph acyclic:

```
user           → (nothing)
session        → user
follow         → user, eventbus
topic          → user
comment        → user, topic
group          → user, eventbus
event          → group, eventbus
chat           → user, FollowChecker (interface, not follow import)
notification   → user (subscribes to eventbus, no feature imports)
oauth          → user
```

Vote logic is absorbed into `topic/` and `comment/` — there is no standalone `vote` slice.

`notification` is never imported by other features. It subscribes to events at boot time, preventing circular dependencies.

## 6. Technology Stack & Runtime Infrastructure

### Backend (Go)
- **Database Engine**: Handled via `platform/database.DB`. Defaults to SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging (`WAL`) enabled and busy timeout (`_busy_timeout=5000`) configured to prevent locking. Portability for PostgreSQL is built-in. Seed data migration (`000009_seed_data`) available as a bonus feature.
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Built-in HTTP upgrade routing to `internal/core/realtime/` with token verification on handshake. Chat messages support Unicode/emoji via standard UTF-8 JSON encoding.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: In-process channel-based Event Bus for localized operations. Portability for RabbitMQ is built-in.

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Architecture**: Next.js App Router providing server and client-side rendering.
- **Component Library**: **shadcn/ui** is used for core reusable elements (buttons, inputs, dialogs, cards, dropdowns, etc.), providing accessible and customizable components.
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** coupled with Vanilla CSS overrides for the design system (glassmorphism, dark/light themes, customized HSL color palettes, and interactive transitions).
- **Communication**: REST APIs for basic CRUD operations, WebSocket channels for real-time chat (emoji support via UTF-8), and SSE for live notifications.
- **UI Conventions**: Destructive operations (unfollow, privacy toggle, decline requests) use `shadcn/ui` Dialog overlays for confirmation. Notifications are displayed in a dedicated panel (bell icon, unread count), visually distinct from the Chat panel.
- **Full spec**: See [SDS §6](sds.md#6-frontend-specifications-nextjs-tailwind-css--shadcnui) for detailed frontend specifications.

### Docker
- **Two containers**: Backend (Go, port 8080) and Frontend (Next.js, port 3000), orchestrated via `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Build script**: Optional `scripts/docker-build.sh` convenience script for automated image building and container startup.

## 7. Development Tooling & SDLC

Quick-reference for all tools used across the software development lifecycle.

### Backend (Go)

| Phase | Tool | Where |
|-------|------|-------|
| Build | `go build` | `Dockerfile` (multi-stage) |
| Testing | `go test -race -coverprofile` | `Makefile` `test` |
| Linting (aggregator, 30+ linters) | `golangci-lint` v2.2.1 | `.golangci.yml` |
| Linting (static analysis) | `staticcheck` | `Makefile` `lint` |
| Linting (official) | `go vet` | `.golangci.yml`, CLI |
| Formatting | `gofmt -s`, `gofumpt` | `Makefile` `format`, `.golangci.yml` |
| Imports | `goimports`, `gci` | `Makefile` `format`, `.golangci.yml` |
| Modules | `go mod tidy` | `Makefile` `ci-mod` |
| Benchmarking | `benchstat` | `Makefile` |
| Profiling | `go tool pprof` | `Makefile` |
| Vuln scanning | `govulncheck` | Manual / CI |

### Frontend (Bun)

| Phase | Tool | Where |
|-------|------|-------|
| Runtime | Bun | `package.json` (scripts) |
| Package manager | Bun | `bun.lock` |
| Linting + formatting | ESLint + Prettier | `eslint.config.mjs` + `.prettierrc` |
| Type checking | `tsc --noEmit` | `package.json` |
| Unit/component tests | Vitest (planned) | `vitest.config.ts` |
| E2E tests | Playwright (planned) | `playwright.config.ts` |

### Infrastructure & CI

| Phase | Tool | Where |
|-------|------|-------|
| Containers | Docker (multi-stage) | `Dockerfile` |
| Orchestration | Docker Compose v5.1.1 | `docker-compose.yml` |
| Dev TLS | `openssl` | `scripts/makecerts.sh` |
| CI pipeline | Makefile `ci` target | `Makefile` |
| Pre-commit hooks | Lefthook | `lefthook.yml` |
| Verification gates | `cmd/gates/main.go` | `Makefile` `review-gates` |
| Go arch lint | `go-arch-lint` | `.go-arch-lint.yml` |
| Security scan | `gosec` | `Makefile` / gates |

### CI Pipeline (`make ci`)

**`make ci`** runs the full gate: backend + frontend.

**Backend** (`make be-ci`):
```
ci-mod → check-format → lint (staticcheck + golangci-lint + govulncheck) → test
```
> `check-format` verifies formatting without modifying. Use `make format` to auto-format before committing.

**Frontend** (`make fe-ci`):
```
bun run lint → bun run format:check → tsc --noEmit → bun run test
```

### Verification Gates (`make review-gates`)

Go-based deterministic gates under `internal/gates/` (see [README](../../internal/gates/README.md)) enforce architectural and convention rules:

| Gate | Tool/Fallback | What It Checks |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Stack | go version / go.mod | Go ≥ 1.24, module path `social-network` |
| Layout | os.Stat | Target directory structure exists |
| Boundaries | golangci-lint depguard / AST | D5 — forbidden cross-slice imports |
| DAG | go-arch-lint / DFS | D6 — dependency graph acyclicity |
| TDD | os.Stat | Test files exist per command/query |
| Migrations | glob / grep | Migration naming (`NNNNNN_name.up.sql`), delimiter (`";"`) |
| Security | gosec / custom AST | SQL concat, WebSocket CheckOrigin, bcrypt cost |
| Branch | regex | Branch naming convention `<user>/<ticket>-<detail>` |
| Coverage | git worktree + go test | Test coverage threshold (>90%) |
| ScopeDrift | git diff | Unplanned file changes |

Output: JSON with exit codes. Run via `make review-gates` or `go run cmd/gates/main.go --all`.

### Pre-commit / Pre-push Hooks (Lefthook)

Configured in `lefthook.yml`:

- **Pre-commit** (staged files, parallel): `gofumpt` + `goimports` on `*.go`, ESLint + Prettier format+lint on frontend. Auto-fixes via `stage_fixed: true`.
- **Pre-push** (parallel): `go vet`, `go test -short`, `go build`, `go-arch-lint check` (backend); `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `vitest` (frontend).

Install: `make setup-hooks`. Bypass: `--no-verify`.

## 8. Requirements Verification

The project's requirements checklist is maintained in [`docs/requirements/audit.md`](../requirements/audit.md). All architectural decisions and feature implementations must satisfy the conditions defined there. Sprint 6 automation tickets (S6-SD-25, S6-SD-34) implement test suites mapped directly to audit.md questions. See also the [progressive disclosure chain](../sprints/general-instructions.md#linear-progressive-disclosure-navigation-chain) (Stage 7).
